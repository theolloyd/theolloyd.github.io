# Claude Instructions for theolloyd.github.io

## Project Information
This is a simple personal website built with HTML.
It is a site for my nephew Theo LLoyd who is sixteen years old.

The site is a mini game.

The mini game is a side scrolling game with a picture of Theo through
fairy floss clouds. If he hits the clouds the game ends. Theo can collect stars for points.
If he gets to a 100 points, Theo wins the game and it says "Happy Birthday Theo."

## Commands
- **Local server**: Use `python -m http.server` to serve the website locally
- **HTML validation**: `html-validate index.html` (if html-validate is installed)

## Code Style Guidelines
- **HTML Structure**: Use proper HTML5 document structure with appropriate tags
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation
- **Colors**: Use hexadecimal color codes (e.g., #9932CC)
- **Images**: Always include alt text for accessibility
- **Formatting**: Keep code clean with consistent indentation and formatting
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose
- **CSS**: Use inline styles sparingly, prefer external CSS for larger projects
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, lowercase file names with hyphens for spaces

## Best Practices
- Ensure site is responsive and accessible
